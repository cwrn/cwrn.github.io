    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        For robots to be our companions in workplaces and homes, we need them to understand the most common modalities of human communication, such as natural language and gestures. Moreover, to solve problems alongside humans, robots need to understand world models that humans express. These problems are complicated because human language is free-form with partially observable intentions, and most environments are unstructured and partially observable. Fortunately, language can be used both to instruct and to guide robots. In particular, natural language provides a common interface between mental models of the world. By learning and leveraging these models, robots can become more effective partners for humans when operating alongside them in shared environments.</p>

    <h3>Call for Papers</h3>

    <p>This workshop aims to gather researchers from the fields of natural language, computer vision, and robotics, to discuss challenges and successes of applying natural language to robotics.  We encourage submissions that do not take robotics problems of planning, actuation, perception, etc. as solved. are important and difficult problems that need to be solved after language understanding, or can use language to augment it

 The workshop will feature invited presentations, a poster session, spolight talks and a panel discussion comprising a mix of experts in the topic area. We welcome submissions on any topic related to language understanding for robotics, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grounding natural language</li>
        <li>Instruction following</li>
        <li>Language synthesis</li>
        <li>Human-robot dialog</li>
        <li>Gesture recognition</li>
        <li>Multimodal communication with robots</li>
        <li>Social communication with robots</li>
        <li>Learning knowledge representations</li>
        <li>Common sense reasoning</li>
        <li>Active concept acquisition</li>
        <li>Visual and linguistic reasoning</li>

<div class="section"><a name="submissions"></a>
		
	<p>Researchers may choose to submit:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Long papers and short papers</b> will present original research and go through the regular SIGdial peer review process by the general SIGdial program committee. These papers will appear in the main SIGdial proceedings and are presented with the main track. Long papers must be no longer than eight pages, including title, text, figures and tables, along with two additional pages for example discourses or dialogues and algorithms. Short papers should be no longer than four pages including title, text, figures and tables, along with one additional page for example discourses or dialogues and algorithms. An unlimited number of pages are allowed for references.</li>
	<li><b>Late-breaking and work-in-progress papers</b> will showcase ongoing work and focused, relevant contributions. Submissions need not present original work and are limited to four pages including references. These will be reviewed by the special session organizers and posted on the special session website. These papers will be presented as lightning talks or posters during the session. Authors will retain the copyright to their work so that they may submit to other venues as their work matures.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h4>Long and short paper deadline: March 11 (<i>Final pdf due March 18</i>)</h4>
	<p>To submit a long or short paper, please go to the <a href="http://www.sigdial.org/workshops/conference19/">SIGDIAL 2018 main page</a> for conference submissions (deadline March 11). When submitting, indicate "Physically Situated Dialogue" as the candidate special session. All long and short submissions must follow the SIGDIAL 2018 format.</p>

	<h4>Late-breaking and work-in-progress paper deadline: April 28</h4>
	<p>To submit a late-breaking or work-in-progress paper, please email a 2-4 page PDF (including references) formatted using the SIGDIAL 2018 format guidelines, to: <a href="mailto:robodial@googlegroups.com">robodial@googlegroups.com</a> by April 28. You will receive a confirmation of your submission and notification before the Early Bird Registration deadline.</p>
