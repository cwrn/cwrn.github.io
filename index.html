        <p>
          For robots to be our companions in workplaces and homes, we need them to understand the most common modalities of human communication, such as natural language and gestures. Moreover, to solve problems alongside humans, robots need to understand world models that humans express. These problems are complicated because human language is free-form with partially observable intentions, and most environments are unstructured and partially observable. Fortunately, language can be used both to instruct and to guide robots. In particular, natural language provides a common interface between mental models of the world. By learning and leveraging these models, robots can become more effective partners for humans when operating alongside them in shared environments.

    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>

    <p>This workshop aims to gather researchers from the fields of natural language, computer vision, and robotics, to discuss challenges and successes of applying natural language to robotics.  We encourage submissions that do not take robotics problems of planning, actuation, perception, etc. as solved. are important and difficult problems that need to be solved after language understanding, or can use language to augment it

 The workshop will feature invited presentations, a poster session, spolight talks and a panel discussion comprising a mix of experts in the topic area. We welcome submissions on any topic related to language understanding for robotics, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grounding natural language</li>
        <li>Instruction following</li>
        <li>Language synthesis</li>

You MAY NOT hand in ANYTHING - code, graphs, or writing - that is not your own original work. Write your own code, generate your own graphs, prove your own theorems, write your own reports. NO EXCEPTIONS. You should check with Professor Konidaris if you have any confusion about what is permitted.
